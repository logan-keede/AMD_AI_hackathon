            "question": "On an island, three inhabitants A, B, and C make statements: A says, 'B is a liar.' B says, 'C is a liar.' C says, 'A and B are of different types.' If exactly one is liar, who are the truth-tellers?",
            "choices": [
                "A) A and B",
                "B) B and C",
                "C) A and C",
                "D) None"
            ],
            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "If we assume A to be the liar, then it means it lied about B being a liar. So that makes B a truth-teller. So it means that according to B's statement, C is a liar. So A and B are of the same type. But A is a liar and B is a truth-teller. This leads to a contradiction. Hence, A has to be a truth-teller. So this makes B a liar. This indicates that C is a truth-teller and A and B are of different types. So A and C are the truth tellers. This makes the third option, C, the correct option."

    "question": "Two people, Red and Blue, stand before you. Red says, “We are both knaves.” What are they really?",
    "choices": [
      "A) Red is truth-teller",
      "B) Blue is is truth-teller",
      "C) Both are truth-tellers",
      "D) Both are liars"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Red cannot be a truth-teller, because then he would be lying by saying he is a liar. Therefore he is a liar, and his statement is a lie, meaning that Blue must be a truth-teller."

    "question": "A new island is discovered, with a third type of inhabitant: spies, who can either tell the truth or lie. You encounter three people, one of each, but you don’t know which is which. Red says, “I am a truth-teller.” Blue says, “Red is telling the truth.” Green says, “I am the spy.” Who is what?",
    "choices": [
      "A) Red is truth-teller",
      "B) Blue is is truth-teller",
      "C) Both are truth-teller",
      "D) Green is the truth-teller"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Could Blue be lying? That would mean that Red is also lying, so Green would have to be the truth-teller. But Green cannot be the truth-teller, because the truth-teller would not lie about who he is. Therefore Blue is telling the truth, so Red is the truth-teller. Since Blue is a non-truth-teller who told the truth, he must be the spy, making Green the liar."
