        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "D is two left of E, so E is two right of D. B is opposite F, and A is between B and F. C is adjacent to G, placing G next to C. Only G fits between D and E without conflict."

        "answer": "B",

If P is the truth-teller, then Q is a liar, making R a liar, which fits. However, R's statement 'P is a liar' would be false, making R a liar, which is consistent. But this would mean two liars (Q and R), contradicting the condition. If R is the truth-teller, then P is a liar, making Q a truth-teller, again two truth-tellers. Only if Q is the truth-teller and P and R are liars, but this leads to contradiction. Thus, the only consistent configuration is Q as truth-teller, P and R as liars, making B correct."

If X is the knight, then Y is a knave, making Z's statement true (X is a knave), which contradicts X being a knight. If Z is the knight, then X is a knave, making Y's statement false, so Y is a knave, and X's statement is false, making X a knave. Only Y being the knight fits without contradiction."
