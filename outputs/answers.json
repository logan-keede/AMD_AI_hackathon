Then Z's statement that X and Y are of the same type would be false, which is consistent because X is a truth-teller and Y is a liar. This makes exactly two liars (Y and Z), so X is the truth-teller. Hence, the answer is A.",

From these constraints, B cannot be next to G as G is between A and C, and A is two seats from B. F is three seats apart from E, so they are not next to each other.

If Y is the truth-teller, then Z is a truth-teller, but Z's statement would be a lie, again a contradiction. If Z is the truth-teller, then X is a liar, making Y's statement true, which means Z is a truth-teller. This fits with exactly two liars (X and Y). Thus, Z is the truth-teller.",
